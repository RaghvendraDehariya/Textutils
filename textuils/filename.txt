Teradata Service Control :
Teradata service control involves managing the start, stop, and status of individual Teradata system
services, often via scripts found in the /etc/init.d directory for components like Teradata
Viewpoint, or through the broader Teradata Customer Services (TCS) framework for overall change
control and system management. Customers must also manage their own responsibilities for
monitoring their systems and implementing software changes through the documented change
control process and service policies.This is my first text typingWinner always a loser.This is second line.yes i am you too.I am worthy of  all the money.this is good website.this is good day.
